# Causality is now Causalism
### Welcome to the repo for Causalism FKA Causality.

This is a near defunt repo for the [Causalism](https://causalism.live/) website. It has also functioned as a proving ground for testing GitHub features. It currently serves as a landing page while the main website is under construction.

The current landing page features a 3D object, Causal Loop Diagram Orb (CLD Orb), that users can rotate around a single axis. The environment for the CLD Orb is an image of the [Orion Nebula](https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/162284main_image_feature_693_ys_full-jpg.webp) taken by NASA's Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes. The CLD Orb is a 3d revolution of a 2d symbol for causality. Each point on the 2D symbol is rotated about an axis to create the 3D CLD Orb.

# Coming Soon(ish)

  - zoom
  - free hand rotation
  - viewports
